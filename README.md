<H1>RECLAIMING THE COSMOS: Fostering a Connection to the Night Sky in the Scottish Highlands and Islands </H1>

<i>Unity VR Project - Interactive Star Map of Community Asterisms collected during Canna Naturefest 2025 on the Isle of Canna, UK as part of my MDES Design Innovation and Interaction Design Masters Project at the Glasgow School of Art. </i>

<H3>Challenge</H3>
Emerging technologies and scientific advancement provide greater access to the night sky, or ‘cosmos’ than ever before. Despite this, humanity and the more-than-human natural world has never experienced a greater disconnection from dark skies and to each other. As we reframe the cosmos as our ancestral commons, how might residents of the Scottish Highlands and Islands overcome the barriers that separate them from dark skies and “reclaim” their personal relationship with the night sky by creating their own personal or community asterisms (star stories)?

<H3>Proposal</H3>
This project explores the creation of custom star maps as a collective, regional storytelling tool to connect local Scottish communities to the cosmos. I visited the Isle of Canna (National Trust for Scotland) and engaged with residents and visitors through participatory design who connected real patterns of stars to create asterisms, or “star stories” of their experiences during Canna Naturefest 2025. An interactive star map, explorable through web and VR, was designed to share these stories, and resources were developed to help other regions across Scotland create their own storytelling star maps to connect local communities to the cosmos.
